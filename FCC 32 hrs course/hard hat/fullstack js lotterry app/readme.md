`# Solidity Raffle Smart Contract

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

The Solidity Raffle Smart Contract is a decentralized application (Dapp) that facilitates a fair raffle game. It uses Chainlink VRF for randomness and Chainlink Keeper for automated upkeep. This README provides an overview of the contract's structure, functionality, and deployment.

## Introduction

The Solidity Raffle Smart Contract allows users to participate in a raffle by entering with Ether (ETH). When the raffle is closed, the contract uses Chainlink VRF to pick a random winner from the participants. The winner receives the contract's balance in Ether.

## Features

- **Raffle State Management:** The contract has two states, "Open" and "Closed," to control when users can enter the raffle.
- **Chainlink VRF Integration:** It uses Chainlink VRF for secure and verifiable randomness.
- **Chainlink Keeper Integration:** Automated upkeep ensures that the raffle is maintained and winners are selected.
- **Entrance Fee:** Users must pay an entrance fee in ETH to participate in the raffle.
- **Winner Selection:** A random winner is selected when the raffle is closed.
- **Ownership Control:** The contract owner can trigger upkeep manually.

## Usage

To participate in the raffle, users can follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have an Ethereum wallet with Ether (ETH).
2. Connect your wallet to a compatible Ethereum interface (e.g., MetaMask).
3. Call the `enterRaffle` function by sending the desired entrance fee in ETH.

The winner will be randomly selected when the contract owner triggers upkeep (usually done automatically by Chainlink Keeper).

## Installation

To run this contract locally or on your preferred Ethereum testnet, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solidity-raffle-contract.git `

1.  Navigate to the project directory:

    shellCopy code

    `cd solidity-raffle-contract`

2.  Install the necessary dependencies:

    shellCopy code

    `npm install`

3.  Customize the contract parameters (e.g., entrance fee, interval) in the contract constructor located in `Raffle.sol`.

4.  Compile the contract:

    shellCopy code

    `npx hardhat compile` or `yarn hardhat compile`

5.  Write tests for your contract (optional) and run them:

    shellCopy code

    `npx hardhat test`

Deployment
----------

Deploying the contract to a live Ethereum network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Rinkeby testnet) requires setting up your deployment configurations and funding the contract with LINK tokens for Chainlink VRF. Consult Chainlink's documentation for deploying VRF-enabled contracts.
